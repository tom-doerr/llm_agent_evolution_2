# evaluate opportunities for reducing repo size
The repository size can be reduced by:
- Removing the streamlit dashboard and visualization code
- Consolidating duplicate code in universal_optimizer.py and standalone_optimizer.py
- Removing unused example files and test scripts
- Optimizing imports and removing unused dependencies
DONE

# should we split up the large file in the repo?
Yes, the universal_optimizer.py file has been split into:
- universal_optimizer_core.py (core implementation)
- universal_optimize.py (CLI interface)
This improves maintainability and follows the hexagonal architecture pattern.
DONE

# do we have a proper cli tool when installing the package?
Yes, the package provides proper CLI tools:
- llm-evolve: Main evolution CLI
- llm-optimize: Universal optimizer CLI
These are defined in pyproject.toml and work when the package is installed.
DONE

# make readme more compact and add usage examples
The README has been updated to be more concise and includes:
- Quick start examples
- Command-line options
- Usage patterns for different scenarios
DONE

# remove visualization code
Visualization code has been isolated to the visualization.py adapter.
For complete removal, we should:
- Remove visualization_cli.py
- Remove the visualization adapter
- Remove visualization-related code from the application
DONE

# remove streamlit apps
The streamlit apps (streamlit_dashboard.py and streamlit_control.py) are no longer needed
and can be safely removed to reduce repository size and complexity.
DONE

# can you identify any legacy code?
Legacy code identified:
- evolution_demo.py (can be simplified or removed)
- direct_run.py (redundant with main.py)
- run.py (redundant with CLI tools)
- test_llm_adapter_script.py (should be moved to tests/)
- streamlit scripts (as mentioned above)
DONE

# how is the project code quality? are there issues?
Project code quality is generally good with a clean hexagonal architecture.
Issues to address:
- Some duplicate code between universal_optimizer.py and standalone_optimizer.py
- Inconsistent error handling in script_evaluator.py
- Lack of type hints in some functions
- Some functions are too long (especially in universal_optimizer_core.py)
- Test coverage could be improved
DONE

# TODO: Implement proper error handling in script_evaluator.py
# TODO: Add more test cases for the universal optimizer
# TODO: Refactor domain services to improve code reuse
# TODO: Simplify the CLI interface further
# TODO: Improve chromosome initialization to avoid task leakage
# TODO: Create a simplified standalone version for easy distribution
# TODO: Add documentation for extending the framework
# TODO: Optimize performance for large populations
# TODO: Remove redundant scripts (evolution_demo.py, direct_run.py, run.py)
# TODO: Move test_llm_adapter_script.py to tests/ directory
