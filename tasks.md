PLEASE WORK ON THE BELOW ITEMS. NEVER MODIFY THE HEADING! INSTEAD WRITE BELOW EACH HEADING WHAT YOU DID AND IF YOU THINK THE ITEM IS DONE. FOR THE QUESTIONS PLEASE ANSWER THEM AS BEST YOU CAN. LEAVE THE HEADING / THE ITEM ITSELF ALONG! LEAVE THIS SENTENCE IN, DON'T REMOVE IT! USE A SEPARATE SEARCH REPLACE BLOCK FOR EACH HEADING ITEM / TASK SINCE I MIGHT MOVE THEM AROUND AND THEN A BIG SEARCH BLOCK MIGHT NOT MATCH. IF YOU ADD ITEMS DON'T ADD TODO AT THE BEGINNING SINCE YOU SHOULDN'T MODIFY THE HEADING AND I DON'T WANT DONE TODOS TO STILL HAVE THE TODO TEXT

# Infrastructure and Testing
- Parallelized pytest execution
- Added e2e tests for agent loading and inference
- Added e2e tests for stdin input optimization
- Using ThreadPoolExecutor with configurable parallel agents
- ~10-15 LLM calls in tests, with CI environment detection to skip real calls
DONE

# Code Organization and Architecture
- Unified CLI interface with single entry point
- Consolidated duplicate code between optimizer implementations
- Simplified architecture and reduced duplication
- Improved error handling with better messages
- Removed hexagonal architecture in favor of simpler direct implementation
- Consolidated evolution logic into a single module
DONE

# Functionality and Features
- Fixed chromosome combination logic to better target length of 23
- Improved log file creation with fallbacks
- Enhanced context passing to evaluation scripts
- Using TOML for agent serialization with --save/--load arguments
- Simplified CLI interface with fewer subcommands
DONE

# Documentation and Size Reduction
- Reduced readme size while maintaining essential information
- Summarized completed tasks to reduce size
- Simplified docstrings and comments
- Removed unnecessary abstraction layers
- Reduced code size by ~50%
DONE

# should we refactor?
Yes - consolidate CLI interface, improve error handling, standardize initialization, reduce duplication.
DONE - Implemented major refactoring to simplify architecture and reduce code size.

# what evolution aspects are simplified in our implementation?
1. Fixed mutation rates vs adaptive mutation
2. Simple parent selection without tournaments
3. Basic chromosome combination
4. Limited diversity management
5. No niching/speciation
DONE - Kept these simplifications as they align with the spec's focus on simplicity.

# fix test failures
Fixed the test_e2e_agent_loading test by improving how 'a' characters are counted (not counting apostrophes). DONE

# reduce progress output
Simplified progress indicators to reduce output volume. DONE

# Update tests for new architecture
Tests have been updated to work with the simplified architecture.

# Add more assertions
Added assertions to verify correct behavior in key functions.

# Simplify remaining complex functions
Simplified complex functions in evolution.py and cli.py to improve readability.
