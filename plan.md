# LLM Agent Evolution: Implementation Plan

## Vision
Create a flexible, powerful framework for evolving LLM-based agents through evolutionary algorithms that can optimize for any measurable goal.

## Core Principles
1. **Universal Adaptability**: Optimize for any goal expressible as a numerical reward
2. **Simplicity First**: Keep the core system simple and understandable
3. **Minimal Assumptions**: Domain-agnostic design with few built-in constraints
4. **Evolutionary Intelligence**: System evolves its strategies over time

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Command-Based Evaluation Interface
- External commands receive agent output via stdin
- Commands return numerical reward as their last line of output
- Support for any programming language or evaluation method
- Caching mechanism for efficiency

### 2. Three-Chromosome System
- Task chromosome: The output that gets evaluated
- Mate selection chromosome: Instructions for selecting mates
- Mutation chromosome: Instructions for how to mutate chromosomes

### 3. Continuous Evolution Process
- No discrete generations
- Parent selection using Pareto distribution weighted by fitness^2
- Weighted sampling without replacement
- Chromosome combination at hotspots (punctuation, spaces)

### 4. Universal CLI
- Simple interface for running optimizations
- Support for different output formats
- Integration with existing tools and workflows
- Real-time monitoring and visualization
