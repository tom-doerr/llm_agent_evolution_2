# LLM Agent Evolution Implementation Plan

## Current Status and Next Steps

### Completed
- Basic hexagonal architecture implementation
- Core domain model (Agent, Chromosome)
- Evolution services (parent selection, mating)
- Primary and secondary ports
- Basic adapters for LLM, logging, and statistics
- Multithreading support
- CLI interface

### Current Issues
- Rich library dependency adds complexity and context bloat
- Progress bars consume too much context
- Need to simplify output to be more information-dense

### Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Remove Rich dependency and simplify console output
2. Optimize the evolution algorithm for better performance
3. Improve the mock LLM adapter for better testing
4. Add more unit tests for core functionality
5. Implement better logging with more detailed information
6. Optimize thread synchronization for better performance
7. Add support for saving/loading the best agents

### Implementation Tasks
- [x] Remove Rich dependency from CLI adapter
- [ ] Improve parent selection algorithm
- [ ] Enhance chromosome combination logic
- [ ] Add more assertions and error checking
- [ ] Optimize thread-safe data structures
- [ ] Implement agent serialization/deserialization
- [ ] Add command to export best agents

## Architecture Reminder

The project follows a hexagonal (ports and adapters) architecture:

- **Domain**: Core entities and business logic
  - Agent and Chromosome classes
  - Evolution services (parent selection, mating)

- **Ports**: Interface definitions
  - Primary: Evolution use cases
  - Secondary: LLM, logging, statistics interfaces

- **Adapters**: Implementation of interfaces
  - Primary: CLI interface
  - Secondary: LLM, logging, statistics implementations

## Key Constants
- MAX_CHARS = 1000 (Maximum characters for chromosomes)
- MAX_POPULATION_SIZE = 1000000 (Default population size limit)
- TARGET_LENGTH = 23 (Target length for the hidden goal)
- MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS = 40 (Limit token output for the DSPy LM)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for domain logic
- Integration tests with mock adapters
- End-to-end tests with mock LLM
