# Universal Optimization Framework: Implementation Plan

## Vision
Create a universal optimization framework that can evolve text-based outputs against any measurable goal using script-based evaluation.

## Core Principles
1. **Universal Adaptability**: Optimize for any goal expressible as a numerical reward
2. **Unix Philosophy**: Simple, composable tools that work with existing ecosystems
3. **Minimal Assumptions**: Domain-agnostic design with few built-in constraints
4. **Evolutionary Intelligence**: System evolves its strategies over time

## Architecture Overview

### 1. Script-Based Evaluation Interface
- External scripts receive agent output via stdin
- Scripts return numerical reward as their last line of output
- Support for any programming language or evaluation method
- Caching mechanism for efficiency

### 2. Flexible Chromosome System
- Dynamic chromosome types that can evolve during optimization
- Support for different chromosome representations
- Chromosome combination strategies that adapt to the problem

### 3. Evolutionary Strategy Market
- Multiple evolutionary strategies competing for effectiveness
- Strategy adaptation based on performance
- Maintenance of strategy diversity

### 4. Universal CLI
- Simple interface for running optimizations
- Support for different output formats
- Integration with existing tools and workflows
